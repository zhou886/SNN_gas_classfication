::

    pip install snntorch

::

    import torch, torch.nn as nn
    import snntorch as snn

DataLoading
-----------

Define variables for dataloading.

::

    batch_size = 128
    data_path='/data/mnist'
    device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")

Load MNIST dataset.

::

    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
    from torchvision import datasets, transforms
    
    # Define a transform
    transform = transforms.Compose([
                transforms.Resize((28, 28)),
                transforms.Grayscale(),
                transforms.ToTensor(),
                transforms.Normalize((0,), (1,))])
    
    mnist_train = datasets.MNIST(data_path, train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
    mnist_test = datasets.MNIST(data_path, train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
    
    # Create DataLoaders
    train_loader = DataLoader(mnist_train, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
    test_loader = DataLoader(mnist_test, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

Define Network with snnTorch.
-----------------------------

-  ``snn.Leaky()`` instantiates a simple leaky integrate-and-fire
   neuron.
-  ``spike_grad`` optionally defines the surrogate gradient. If left
   undefined, the relevant gradient term is simply set to the output
   spike itself (1/0) by default.

By default, each LIF neuron returns two values: the spike and hidden state. 
But neurons chained together in ``nn.Sequential`` expect only one value. 
To handle this:

-  ``init_hidden`` initializes the hidden states (e.g., membrane
   potential) as instance variables to be processed in the background.

The final layer is not bound by this constraint, and can return multiple
tensors: 

- ``output=True`` enables the final layer to return the hidden state in addition to the spike.

::

    from snntorch import surrogate
    
    beta = 0.9  # neuron decay rate 
    spike_grad = surrogate.fast_sigmoid() # fast sigmoid surrogate gradient
    
    #  Initialize Convolutional SNN
    net = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv2d(1, 8, 5),
                        nn.MaxPool2d(2),
                        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, spike_grad=spike_grad, init_hidden=True),
                        nn.Conv2d(8, 16, 5),
                        nn.MaxPool2d(2),
                        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, spike_grad=spike_grad, init_hidden=True),
                        nn.Flatten(),
                        nn.Linear(16*4*4, 10),
                        snn.Leaky(beta=beta, spike_grad=spike_grad, init_hidden=True, output=True)
                        ).to(device)

Refer to the snnTorch documentation to see more `neuron
types <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.html>`__ and
`surrogate gradient
options <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.surrogate.html>`__.

Define the Forward Pass
-----------------------

Now define the forward pass over multiple time steps of simulation.

::

    from snntorch import utils 
    
    def forward_pass(net, data, num_steps):  
      spk_rec = [] # record spikes over time
      utils.reset(net)  # reset/initialize hidden states for all LIF neurons in net
    
      for step in range(num_steps): # loop over time
          spk_out, mem_out = net(data) # one time step of the forward-pass
          spk_rec.append(spk_out) # record spikes
      
      return torch.stack(spk_rec)

Define the optimizer and loss function. Here, we use the MSE Count Loss,
which counts up the total number of output spikes at the end of the
simulation run. The correct class has a target firing rate of 80% of all
time steps, and incorrect classes are set to 20%.

::

    import snntorch.functional as SF
    
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=2e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999))
    loss_fn = SF.mse_count_loss(correct_rate=0.8, incorrect_rate=0.2)

Objective functions do not have to be applied to the spike count. They
may be applied to the membrane potential (hidden state), or to
spike-timing targets instead of rate-based methods. A non-exhaustive
list of objective functions available include:

**Apply the objective directly to spikes:** 

* MSE Spike Count Loss: ``mse_count_loss()`` 
* Cross Entropy Spike Count Loss: ``ce_count_loss()`` 
* Cross Entropy Spike Rate Loss: ``ce_rate_loss()``

**Apply the objective to the hidden state:** 

* Cross Entropy Maximum Membrane Potential Loss: ``ce_max_membrane_loss()`` 
* MSE Membrane Potential Loss: ``mse_membrane_loss()``

For alternative objective functions, refer to the
``snntorch.functional`` `documentation
here. <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.functional.html>`__

Training Loop
-------------

Now for the training loop. The predicted class will be set to the neuron
with the highest firing rate, i.e., a rate-coded output. We will just
measure accuracy on the training set. This training loop follows the
same syntax as with PyTorch.

::

    num_epochs = 1 # run for 1 epoch - each data sample is seen only once
    num_steps = 25  # run for 25 time steps 
    
    loss_hist = [] # record loss over iterations 
    acc_hist = [] # record accuracy over iterations
    
    # training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for i, (data, targets) in enumerate(iter(train_loader)):
            data = data.to(device)
            targets = targets.to(device)
    
            net.train() 
            spk_rec = forward_pass(net, data, num_steps) # forward-pass
            loss_val = loss_fn(spk_rec, targets) # loss calculation
            optimizer.zero_grad() # null gradients
            loss_val.backward() # calculate gradients
            optimizer.step() # update weights
            loss_hist.append(loss_val.item()) # store loss
    
            # print every 25 iterations
            if i % 25 == 0:
              print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Iteration {i} \nTrain Loss: {loss_val.item():.2f}")
    
              # check accuracy on a single batch
              acc = SF.accuracy_rate(spk_rec, targets)  
              acc_hist.append(acc)
              print(f"Accuracy: {acc * 100:.2f}%\n")
            
            # uncomment for faster termination
            # if i == 150:
            #     break
    

More control over your model
----------------------------

If you are simulating more complex architectures, such as residual nets,
then your best bet is to wrap the network up in a class as shown below.
This time, we will explicitly use the membrane potential, ``mem``, and
let ``init_hidden`` default to false.

For the sake of speed, we’ll just simulate a fully-connected SNN, but
this can be generalized to other network types (e.g., Convs).

In addition, let’s set the neuron decay rate, ``beta``, to be a
learnable parameter. The first layer will have a shared decay rate
across neurons. Each neuron in the second layer will have an independent
decay rate. The decay is clipped between [0,1].

    import torch.nn.functional as F

            num_outputs = 10 # number of classes (i.e., output neurons)

            beta1 = 0.9 # global decay rate for all leaky neurons in layer 1

                cur1 = self.fc1(x.flatten(1))

                cur2 = self.fc2(spk1)
